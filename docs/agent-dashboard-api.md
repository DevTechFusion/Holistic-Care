## Agent Dashboard API

### GET /api/agent/dashboard

- **Auth**: Sanctum auth required (uses the current authenticated agent)
- **Query Params**:
  - **range**: `daily` | `weekly` | `monthly` | `yearly` (default: `daily`)
  - **department_id**: integer (optional, filters today's appointments and leaderboard by department)
  - **per_page**: integer (default: 20)
  - **page**: integer (default: 1)

### Behavior
- **Range filter**: Applies across the entire dashboard (cards and appointments table).
- **Department filter**: Affects both today's appointments list and today's leaderboard.
- When department_id is provided, both sections show data only from that department.
- When department_id is not provided (or null), both sections show data from all departments.
- Cards displayed: `total_bookings`, `arrived`, `not_arrived`, `rescheduled`.
- Todayâ€™s Appointment Leaderboard always shows top 5 for today (unaffected by the filter).
- A paginated table of all appointments for the agent in the selected range appears at the bottom.
